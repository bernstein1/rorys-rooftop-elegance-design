      <p>At Rory's Rooftop Bar, every cocktail tells a story. High above the bustling streets of the Meatpacking District, our mixology team crafts drinks that capture the essence of New York City's energy and sophistication.</p>
      
      <h2>The Manhattan Sunset</h2>
      <p>Our signature Manhattan Sunset isn't just a drinkâ€”it's an experience. As the golden hour paints the Hudson River in brilliant hues, this bourbon-based cocktail mirrors the moment with its rich amber color and complex flavor profile.</p>
      
      <h2>Rooftop Mule: A Modern Classic</h2>
      <p>The Rooftop Mule puts our unique spin on the beloved Moscow Mule. Served in our custom copper mugs, this cocktail combines premium vodka with house-made ginger beer and a secret blend of herbs that captures the urban garden vibe of our rooftop setting.</p>
      
      <h2>Craft Meets Innovation</h2>
      <p>Our bartenders are artists, combining traditional techniques with modern innovation. Each cocktail is carefully balanced, using only the finest spirits and fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced from local purveyors.</p>
