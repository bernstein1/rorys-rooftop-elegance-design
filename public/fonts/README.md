# Custom Fonts

Place your font files here.

Expected files:
- `Phosphate.woff2` (or `Phosphate.ttc`)
- `JubilatRegular.woff2` (or `JubilatRegular.otf`)

These fonts will be loaded by the application via `@font-face` rules in `src/index.css`.
If you only have the `.ttc` or `.otf` formats, copy them here with the exact names above or convert them to `.woff2` for better performance.
